• Build a Random Forest model with the dataset provided in the shared drive. You are free to do any kind of EDA (using all statistical tools and methodology taught in session) as per your choice and play around with the data. Following are the must have things for submission of project :

        ○ Proper EDA with explanation of impactful and useful variables
        ○ Graphs wherever necessary
        ○ Metrics for model evaluation:
                           • Confusion Matrix
                           • Accuracy Score
                           • F1 score, Precision, Recall, ROC-AUC 
                           • Model Optimization using K fold cross validation

Also ensure that you use Train file for Training the model and Test file for testing the mode

• Consider column B (Risk_flag) as the target (y) variable and rest of the columns as feature variables.
